Content Shelf is shopping cart software for selling digital content, tangible products, services, subscriptions and gift cards.

== Description ==

Content Shelf is a complete solution for selling online and works great with most WordPress sites.

This free plugin installs in less than 5 minutes and includes our demo so you can immediately see how it looks and feels within your WordPress theme.

Content Shelf is free to get started and affordable if you decide to stay.

We offer three account plans:

* Premium - $14 mth
* Premium Plus - $29 mth
* Enterprise - $44 mth

All plans have a 30 day free trial.

If you decide to give us a shot after viewing the demo you'll need to create an account, set up your store then configure your store in WordPress. Don't worry we offer a complete tutorial with screenshots.

If you decide Content Shelf is not for you, our plugin de-installs quickly and does not leave any residual files.
